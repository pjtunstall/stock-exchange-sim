# This is a hand-made log, designed to show what would happen
# if the program gave an output that mistakenly tried to
# do a process that's not possible because there isn't
# enough stock. The real output says to do_doorknobs three
# times. This erroneous log shows what would happen if it
# only ran do_doorknobs twice, so that there aren't enough
# doorknobs to make the cabinet.
